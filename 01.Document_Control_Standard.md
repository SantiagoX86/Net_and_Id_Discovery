# Document Control Standard

* Organization: WAUIG Bank
* Project Name: Enterprise Security Discovery Orchestration Framework
* Document Version: 1.0
* Document Date: 2025-11-20
* Prepared By: Sean Santiago (Developer / Security Engineer)
* Project Manager: Dana Whitlock (Project Manager)
* Security Authority: Chris Boseman (CISO)
* Executive Sponsor: Chad Hemsworth (CEO)

---

## 1. Purpose

The purpose of this Document Control Standard is to establish a consistent governance model for all project artifacts associated with the Enterprise Security Discovery Orchestration Framework. This standard ensures uniform document structure, traceability, accountability, and audit readiness aligned with enterprise security engineering practices.

---

## 2. Scope

This standard applies to all formal project documentation, including but not limited to:

* Project Initiation and Charter documents
* Requirements specifications (FRD/TRD)
* Architecture and design artifacts
* Implementation and test planning documents
* Test results and validation summaries
* Domain specifications

Informal engineering notes, scratch files, and exploratory developer materials are out of scope unless formally promoted to controlled artifacts.

---

## 3. Standard Document Header

All governed documents SHALL include the following header fields immediately beneath the document title:

* Organization
* Project Name
* Document Version
* Document Date
* Prepared By
* Project Manager
* Security Authority
* Executive Sponsor

### 3.1 Header Format

The required canonical format is:

```
* Organization: WAUIG Bank  
* Project Name: Enterprise Security Discovery Orchestration Framework  
* Document Version: <version>  
* Document Date: <YYYY-MM-DD>  
* Prepared By: Sean Santiago (Developer / Security Engineer)  
* Project Manager: Dana Whitlock (Project Manager)  
* Security Authority: Chris Boseman (CISO)  
* Executive Sponsor: Chad Hemsworth (CEO)  
```

---

## 4. Versioning Standards

### 4.1 Version Format

Documents SHALL use semantic-style versioning:

* **Major version (X.0)** — structural or scope changes
* **Minor version (X.Y)** — content updates or clarifications

Examples:

* 1.0 — initial approved version
* 1.1 — minor revision
* 2.0 — major redesign

---

### 4.2 Version Control Practices

* Version numbers MUST increment monotonically
* Document Date MUST reflect last material update
* Git history SHALL be considered the system of record for change traceability
* Major version changes SHOULD be accompanied by commit notes explaining scope impact

---

## 5. Dating Standard

* All dates SHALL use ISO format: `YYYY-MM-DD`
* All runtime telemetry within the framework SHALL use UTC
* Document dates MUST fall within the active project timeline

---

## 6. Role Authority Model

The following role assignments are authoritative for this project and SHALL remain consistent across documents unless formally revised.

| Role                                      | Assigned Individual |
| ----------------------------------------- | ------------------- |
| Developer / Security Engineer             | Sean Santiago       |
| Project Manager                           | Dana Whitlock       |
| Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) | Chris Boseman       |
| Chief Executive Officer (CEO)             | Chad Hemsworth      |

Any future role changes must be reflected first in the Project Initiation Document before propagating to other artifacts.

---

## 7. Migration Guidance for Legacy Documents

To maintain delivery velocity, previously created documents are **not required to be immediately reformatted**.

Recommended approach:

* New documents SHALL follow this standard
* Existing documents SHOULD be normalized opportunistically during updates
* Cosmetic-only bulk refactoring is discouraged during active development phases

---

## 8. Compliance and Review

Compliance with this standard will be reviewed during:

* Phase gate reviews
* Major milestone validations
* Pre-release documentation audits

Non-compliant documents should be remediated during the next scheduled update cycle.

---
