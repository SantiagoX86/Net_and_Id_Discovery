# Technical Requirements Document (TRD)

* Organization: WAUIG Bank
* Project Name: Enterprise Security Discovery Orchestration Framework
* Document Version: 1.0
* Document Date: 2025-12-15

---

## 1. Purpose

This Technical Requirements Document (TRD) defines **how the functional requirements of the Enterprise Security Discovery Orchestration Framework will be technically realized**, without prescribing detailed implementation or code structure.

The TRD establishes the approved **technical constraints, standards, interfaces, and environmental assumptions** that guide design and implementation activities under the WAUIG Bank Secure Development Lifecycle (SDLC).

---

## 2. Relationship to Other Documents

This document:

* Derives from the approved **Functional Requirements Document (FRD)**
* Constrains the **Architecture and Design** phase
* Serves as a baseline for **implementation and testing validation**

No design or implementation decisions may violate the requirements defined herein.

---

## 3. Technical Scope

The technical requirements defined in this document apply to:

* Core discovery orchestration framework
* Network Discovery domain (initial release)
* Supporting execution, output, and error-handling mechanisms

Future discovery domains must conform to the same technical constraints unless formally amended through change control.

---

## 4. Platform and Environment Requirements

### TR-ENV-1: Execution Environment

The framework shall execute on Linux-based operating systems commonly used for security engineering and assessment.

**Requirements:**

* Primary development and execution environment: Kali Linux
* Python runtime version: Python 3.10 or later

---

### TR-ENV-2: Target Environment Compatibility

The framework shall support discovery against Windows-based systems without requiring host-side agents.

**Requirements:**

* Target operating systems: Windows 10, Windows 11, Windows Server (supported versions)
* No software installation on target systems

---

## 5. Language and Runtime Requirements

### TR-LANG-1: Programming Language

The framework shall be implemented using Python.

**Requirements:**

* Use of Python standard library is preferred
* Third-party dependencies must be minimal and justified

---

### TR-LANG-2: Privilege Model

The framework shall operate without elevated privileges on the execution host.

**Requirements:**

* No raw socket access
* No kernel-level operations

---

## 6. Architecture and Interface Requirements

### TR-ARCH-1: Modular Architecture

The framework shall employ a modular architecture separating:

* Core orchestration logic
* Discovery domain implementations

---

### TR-ARCH-2: Domain Interface Contract

All discovery domains shall implement a common interface.

**Requirements:**

* Standardized execution method
* Standardized output format
* No cross-domain dependencies

---

### TR-ARCH-3: Data Model Consistency

The framework shall use consistent data models for context and findings.

**Requirements:**

* Strongly structured data objects
* Serializable formats for output

---

## 7. Network Discovery Technical Requirements

### TR-ND-1: Network Interaction Model

The Network Discovery domain shall rely exclusively on standard OS networking APIs.

**Requirements:**

* TCP connect-based probing only
* No raw packet crafting
* No protocol fuzzing

---

### TR-ND-2: Port Selection Strategy

The Network Discovery domain shall limit probing to a predefined set of enterprise-relevant ports.

**Requirements:**

* Port list must be configurable
* Default ports must be documented

---

## 8. Output and Reporting Requirements

### TR-OUT-1: Structured Output

The framework shall produce structured output suitable for automated processing.

**Requirements:**

* JSON-compatible data structures
* Deterministic field naming

---

### TR-OUT-2: Evidence Preservation

The framework shall preserve raw evidence supporting each finding.

**Requirements:**

* Evidence must include discovery method identifiers
* Evidence must support independent verification

---

## 9. Error Handling and Logging

### TR-ERR-1: Error Resilience

The framework shall handle execution errors gracefully.

**Requirements:**

* Failures in one domain must not terminate execution
* Errors must be captured and reported

---

### TR-ERR-2: Logging

The framework shall provide basic execution logging.

**Requirements:**

* Log discovery start and end
* Log errors without exposing sensitive information

---

## 10. Security and Compliance Requirements

### TR-SEC-1: Non-Destructive Operation

The framework shall not alter target system state.

---

### TR-SEC-2: Non-Exploitative Behavior

The framework shall not attempt exploitation, authentication, or persistence.

---

### TR-SEC-3: Audit Support

The framework shall support audit and review activities.

**Requirements:**

* Clear linkage between findings and methods
* Timestamped observations

---

## 11. Performance Requirements

### TR-PERF-1: Execution Efficiency

The framework shall complete network discovery operations within reasonable time bounds.

**Requirements:**

* Default network discovery run completes within minutes for single-host targets
* Timeouts must be configurable

---

## 12. Out-of-Scope Technical Capabilities

The following technical capabilities are explicitly excluded:

* Raw packet manipulation
* Credential storage or handling
* Exploit payload generation
* Continuous or autonomous operation

---

## 13. Approval

Approval of this Technical Requirements Document authorizes progression to the **Design phase** of the WAUIG Bank SDLC.
