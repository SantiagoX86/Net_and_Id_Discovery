# Architecture Design Document (ADD)

* Organization: WAUIG Bank
* Project Name: Enterprise Security Discovery Orchestration Framework
* Document Version: 1.0
* Document Date: 2025-12-20

---

## SDLC Gate Notice

**SDLC Status:** Phase 3 – Design (Authorized)
**Prerequisites:** Approved FRD and TRD

> This document is **mandatory** and **not skippable**. It translates approved requirements into a concrete architectural blueprint. No production implementation may proceed until this document is approved.

---

## 1. Purpose

This Architecture Design Document (ADD) defines the **structural blueprint** of the Enterprise Security Discovery Orchestration Framework. It specifies component boundaries, responsibilities, data flows, and interfaces while remaining compliant with the approved Functional and Technical Requirements.

This document intentionally avoids code-level detail and focuses on **system structure and interaction**.

---

## 2. Architectural Objectives

The architecture is designed to:

* Enforce strict separation between orchestration and discovery logic
* Support modular expansion via pluggable discovery domains
* Ensure auditable, deterministic, and repeatable discovery execution
* Prevent architectural drift into exploit or agent-based tooling

---

## 3. High-Level Architecture Overview

The framework is composed of four primary architectural layers:

1. **Entry / Control Layer**
2. **Core Orchestration Layer**
3. **Discovery Domain Layer**
4. **Output & Reporting Layer**

Each layer is loosely coupled and communicates through well-defined interfaces.

---

## 4. Component Architecture

### 4.1 Entry / Control Layer

**Responsibilities:**

* Accept execution parameters (target, domains, configuration)
* Initialize discovery context
* Trigger orchestrated execution

**Notes:**

* Implemented later as `main.py` or CLI
* Contains no discovery logic

---

### 4.2 Core Orchestration Layer

**Responsibilities:**

* Maintain the discovery lifecycle
* Distribute context to domains
* Aggregate and normalize findings
* Enforce execution contracts

**Key Components:**

* DiscoveryContext
* DiscoveryFinding
* DiscoveryModule (abstract base)
* DiscoveryOrchestrator

---

### 4.3 Discovery Domain Layer

**Responsibilities:**

* Perform domain-specific discovery
* Generate normalized findings
* Adhere to discovery invariants

**Initial Domains:**

* Network Discovery

**Future Domains (Planned):**

* Identity Discovery
* Host Configuration Discovery
* Application & Service Discovery
* Logging & Telemetry Discovery

Domains:

* Must be independently deployable
* Must not depend on other domains

---

### 4.4 Output & Reporting Layer

**Responsibilities:**

* Serialize normalized findings
* Support multiple output formats
* Preserve raw evidence

**Planned Formats:**

* JSON (primary)
* Markdown (human-readable)
* CSV (optional)

---

## 5. Data Flow Description

1. Entry layer receives execution parameters
2. DiscoveryContext is created
3. Orchestrator initializes domains
4. Domains execute sequentially
5. Findings are emitted to orchestrator
6. Findings are normalized and serialized

No domain-to-domain data sharing is permitted.

---

## 6. Interface Contracts

### 6.1 Discovery Domain Interface

All discovery domains must:

* Accept a DiscoveryContext
* Implement a standard `execute()` method
* Return a list of DiscoveryFinding objects

---

### 6.2 Finding Data Contract

All findings must include:

* Domain identifier
* Category
* Target identifier
* Evidence object
* Confidence score
* Timestamp

---

## 7. Security Architecture Considerations

* No authentication or credential handling components
* No persistent state between executions
* No raw packet or kernel-level access
* All actions attributable to specific methods

---

## 8. Design Constraints

The architecture shall not:

* Introduce inter-domain dependencies
* Allow discovery domains to modify execution flow
* Permit uncontrolled concurrency

---

## 9. Design Risks and Mitigations

| Risk                              | Mitigation                                |
| --------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| Domain creep into exploitation    | Architectural invariants and review gates |
| Tight coupling between components | Strict interface contracts                |
| Future redesign pressure          | Modular, layered architecture             |

---

## 10. Traceability to Requirements

| Requirement                    | Architectural Element    |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------ |
| FR-1 Orchestration             | Core Orchestration Layer |
| FR-3 Modular Domains           | Discovery Domain Layer   |
| FR-4 Normalized Output         | Output & Reporting Layer |
| TR-ARCH-1 Modular Architecture | Layered design           |

---

## 11. Approval

Approval of this Architecture Design Document authorizes progression to the **Construct (Implementation) Phase** of the WAUIG Bank SDLC.
