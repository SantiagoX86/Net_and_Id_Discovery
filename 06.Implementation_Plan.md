# Implementation Plan

* Organization: WAUIG Bank
* Project Name: Enterprise Security Discovery Orchestration Framework
* Document Version: 1.0
* Document Date: 2026-01-08

---

## 1. Purpose

This Implementation Plan defines the build sequence, milestones, and verification activities for Phase 4 (Construct) of the WAUIG Bank SDLC. It ensures implementation proceeds in a controlled, reviewable manner aligned to the approved FRD, TRD, and Architecture Design Document (ADD).

---

## 2. Implementation Principles

* Build the **core framework contract first**, then implement Network Discovery as the initial reference domain
* Maintain strict alignment to approved requirements; architecture changes require change control
* Preserve auditability: every functional requirement must map to test evidence
* Prefer standard library dependencies unless an exception is approved

---

## 3. Work Breakdown Structure (WBS)

### 3.1 Core Framework (Milestone M1)

**Objective:** Establish reusable core components required by all domains.

**Planned Deliverables:**

* DiscoveryContext model
* DiscoveryFinding model (normalized findings contract)
* DiscoveryModule abstract base class (domain interface)
* DiscoveryOrchestrator (lifecycle coordination)
* Baseline error-handling patterns

**Acceptance Criteria:**

* Core components are implemented with stable interfaces
* Orchestrator supports executing one or more modules sequentially
* Failures in a module do not terminate the overall run

---

### 3.2 Network Discovery Domain v1 (Milestone M2)

**Objective:** Implement the first discovery domain in compliance with invariants and contracts.

**Planned Deliverables:**

* Host reachability detection (non-exploitative)
* TCP connect-based port discovery (predefined port list)
* Heuristic service mapping
* Evidence attribution per finding

**Acceptance Criteria:**

* Findings conform exactly to normalized finding schema
* No raw packet logic and no credential handling
* Output is repeatable under unchanged conditions

---

### 3.3 Output & Reporting v1 (Milestone M3)

**Objective:** Produce enterprise-consumable output artifacts.

**Planned Deliverables:**

* JSON output serializer
* Markdown report serializer (human-readable)
* Optional CSV serializer (if required)

**Acceptance Criteria:**

* Findings serialize deterministically with consistent field names
* Reports preserve evidence and timestamps

---

### 3.4 Entry / Control Layer (CLI) v1 (Milestone M4)

**Objective:** Provide a controlled execution entrypoint.

**Planned Deliverables:**

* `main.py` entrypoint
* CLI arguments for target and domain selection
* Configurable timeouts and port list source

**Acceptance Criteria:**

* Execution parameters create a DiscoveryContext
* Orchestrator runs requested domains and produces output

---

### 3.5 Refactoring into Package Layout (Milestone M5)

**Objective:** Split prototype code into enterprise-style module structure.

**Planned Deliverables:**

* `/core` package
* `/domains/network` package
* `/output` package
* `/config` defaults

**Acceptance Criteria:**

* No change to behavior; structural refactor only
* Imports and execution remain stable

---

## 4. Verification Plan (Construct-Phase)

Verification during Construct will be performed continuously and documented for later Test-phase sign-off.

**Verification Activities:**

* Unit-level checks for data model serialization
* Controlled lab runs (Kali → Windows VM)
* Regression re-runs after changes to ensure determinism

**Evidence Artifacts:**

* Example JSON outputs
* Example Markdown reports
* Recorded test runs (notes + timestamps)

---

## 5. Phase Gate Dependencies

* M1 must complete before M2
* M2 must complete before M3
* M3 must complete before M4
* M4 must complete before M5

Any deviation requires documentation and (if architectural) change control.

## 6. Risks and Mitigations

| Risk                               | Impact | Mitigation                                             |
| ---------------------------------- | ------ | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| Design drift during implementation | High   | Require reviews vs FRD/TRD/ADD before merging changes  |
| Scope creep into exploit behaviors | High   | Enforce discovery invariants; reject non-compliant PRs |
| Non-deterministic results          | Medium | Add run metadata; constrain timeouts; regression runs  |
| Environment variance (lab)         | Low    | Standardize VM snapshots and config baselines          |

---

## 7. Roles and Review Cadence

* Developer: Sean Santiago
* Code Reviewers: Liam Porter (Security Engineering), Evelyn Ross (Principal Engineer)
* Milestone Review: Marcus Hale (Security Architecture Lead)

**Cadence:**

* Weekly working sessions
* Milestone review at completion of M1–M5

---

## 8. Approvals

Approval authorizes implementation work to proceed under Phase 4 (Construct).
