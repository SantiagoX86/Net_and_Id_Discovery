# Functional Requirements Document (FRD)

* Organization: WAUIG Bank
* Project Name: Enterprise Security Discovery Orchestration Framework
* Document Version: 1.0
* Document Date: 2025-12-10

---

## 1. Purpose

This Functional Requirements Document (FRD) defines **what the Enterprise Security Discovery Orchestration Framework must do**, independent of implementation details.

The FRD translates approved business needs and project objectives into verifiable functional capabilities and establishes a baseline for design, development, and testing under the WAUIG Bank Secure Development Lifecycle (SDLC).

---

## 2. Scope

This document applies to the initial release of the Enterprise Security Discovery Orchestration Framework, with emphasis on the **Network Discovery domain** and shared core framework capabilities.

This FRD does not define technical implementation details, architectures, or specific technologies, which are addressed in the Technical Requirements and Design phases.

---

## 3. Assumptions and Constraints

### Assumptions

* The framework will be executed by authorized WAUIG Bank security personnel
* Discovery activities will be conducted in controlled environments
* Output will be reviewed by security engineers or analysts

### Constraints

* The framework must operate without credentials
* The framework must not modify target system state
* The framework must not attempt exploitation or authentication
* All functionality must comply with WAUIG Bank SDLC and security governance

---

## 4. Functional Overview

The framework shall provide:

* Orchestration of discovery activities
* Modular discovery domains
* Normalized and auditable findings
* Deterministic and repeatable execution

Each discovery domain shall conform to common execution, output, and safety contracts.

---

## 5. Core Functional Requirements

### FR-1: Discovery Orchestration

The system shall coordinate execution of one or more discovery domains during a single discovery run.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

* Multiple discovery domains can be executed sequentially
* Failure in one domain does not prevent execution of others

---

### FR-2: Discovery Context Management

The system shall maintain a discovery context capturing execution metadata and assumptions.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

* Context includes target identifier, timestamp, execution source, and assumptions
* Context is accessible to all discovery domains

---

### FR-3: Modular Discovery Domains

The system shall support independently developed discovery domains that share a common interface.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

* Domains can be added or removed without modifying core orchestration logic
* All domains adhere to a standardized execution contract

---

### FR-4: Normalized Findings Output

The system shall produce normalized discovery findings using a consistent data structure.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

* Each finding includes domain, category, target, evidence, confidence, and timestamp
* Findings are serializable for reporting and storage

---

### FR-5: Deterministic Execution

The system shall produce consistent results when executed against unchanged targets under identical conditions.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

* Repeated runs under identical conditions produce equivalent findings
* Variance is attributable to environmental changes

---

## 6. Network Discovery Functional Requirements

### FR-ND-1: Host Reachability Detection

The system shall determine whether a target host is reachable from the execution vantage point.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

* Host reachability is assessed using non-exploitative methods
* Results indicate positive or negative reachability

---

### FR-ND-2: Exposed Port Identification

The system shall identify exposed TCP ports on the target host.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

* Discovery is limited to a predefined set of enterprise-relevant ports
* Only confirmed open ports are reported

---

### FR-ND-3: Service Identification (Heuristic)

The system shall associate discovered ports with likely service identifiers.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

* Service identification is heuristic and non-authenticated
* No banner parsing requires credentials

---

### FR-ND-4: Evidence Attribution

The system shall associate each network discovery finding with clear supporting evidence.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

* Evidence identifies the discovery method used
* Evidence is sufficient for independent verification

---

## 7. Security and Safety Functional Requirements

### FR-S-1: Non-Destructive Operation

The system shall not alter the state of any target system.

---

### FR-S-2: Non-Exploitative Behavior

The system shall not perform exploitation, brute-force attempts, or vulnerability triggering.

---

### FR-S-3: Auditability

The system shall ensure all discovery actions are attributable and reviewable.

---

## 8. Error Handling and Resilience

### FR-E-1: Graceful Failure

The system shall handle network and execution errors without terminating the discovery run.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

* Errors are captured and reported
* Partial results are preserved

---

## 9. Out-of-Scope Functionalities

The following functionalities are explicitly excluded:

* Credentialed scanning
* Exploit development or delivery
* Persistence mechanisms
* Autonomous or continuous execution

---

## 10. Traceability to Business Objectives

| Business Objective       | Related Functional Requirements |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------- |
| Safe exposure assessment | FR-1, FR-4, FR-S-1              |
| Repeatable discovery     | FR-2, FR-5                      |
| Modular expansion        | FR-3                            |

---

## 11. Approval

Approval of this Functional Requirements Document authorizes progression to the **Technical Requirements and Design phases** of the WAUIG Bank SDLC.
