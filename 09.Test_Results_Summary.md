## 1. Purpose

The Test Results Summary provides a consolidated record of significant validation activities performed against the Enterprise Security Discovery Orchestration Framework. This document captures milestone-quality test outcomes to demonstrate functional correctness, architectural stability, and expected discovery behavior under controlled lab conditions.

The summary is intended to support:

* Engineering validation tracking
* Security review and audit readiness
* Regression awareness across milestones
* Portfolio and stakeholder visibility

---

## 2. Scope

This document records **material validation checkpoints** across the following discovery domains:

* Network Discovery
* Identity Discovery
* Host Configuration Discovery (future)
* Application & Service Discovery (future)
* Logging & Telemetry Discovery (future)

Routine developer runs and exploratory testing are not required to be logged unless they produce findings that materially affect system behavior or risk posture.

---

## 3. Test Environment

Unless otherwise specified per entry, validations are performed in the controlled WAUIG Bank lab environment:

* Source Host: Kali Linux VM (agentless vantage point)
* Target Host: Windows VM (sandbox configuration)
* Execution Model: Non-exploitative, no-credential discovery
* Network Mode: VMware Host-Only
* Time Source: UTC normalized

Environment-specific deviations will be documented within individual test entries.

---

## 4. Entry Criteria

Test results are recorded in this summary when one or more of the following conditions are met:

* Cross-module integration is validated
* New discovery capability is introduced
* Contract or schema changes are implemented
* Security posture observations are confirmed
* Regression risk is evaluated

---

## 5. Exit Criteria

A test entry is considered complete when:

* Expected behavior is defined
* Observed behavior is captured
* Findings evidence is preserved
* No unhandled exceptions occur
* Results are reproducible under the documented conditions
